# Quality Management

## Version Control and Code Management
Akadimi's development utilizes GitHub for version control, ensuring structured code management, collaboration, and bug tracking. Detailed developer documentation is included in the repository.

## Manual Testing and Test Cases
In addition to automated testing, Akadimi incorporates **manual testing** as part of our quality assurance process. We create detailed **test cases** to ensure that the platform meets the desired quality standards before releasing updates or new features.

### Test Case Scenarios
Our team designs comprehensive **test scenarios** to evaluate various functionalities of the Akadimi platform. These scenarios are executed manually to simulate real-world usage and identify any potential issues or bugs. The test cases cover:

- **User Interface Testing**: Ensuring the platform's design is consistent, responsive, and user-friendly across all devices.
- **Functionality Testing**: Verifying that all core features, such as the reading view, backpack, annotations, and AI tools, work as expected under different conditions.
- **Security Testing**: Performing checks to ensure that user data is handled securely and in compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR.
- **Performance Testing**: Simulating heavy traffic conditions to ensure the platform can handle high usage without performance degradation.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensuring compatibility across popular browsers like **Chrome**, **Safari**, **Firefox**, and **Edge**.

### Continuous Testing Cycle
Testing is an ongoing process at Akadimi, and we follow a rigorous testing cycle that includes:
1. **Test Case Creation**: Test cases are written based on new features, updates, and reported issues.
2. **Test Execution**: The team manually executes the test cases, ensuring all areas of the application are covered.
3. **Bug Reporting**: Any issues or bugs found during testing are documented and reported to the development team for resolution.
4. **Test Re-testing**: After bugs are fixed, test cases are re-executed to ensure the issue is resolved and that no new issues have been introduced.

Our approach to **manual testing** ensures that Akadimiâ€™s features are thoroughly vetted and validated before they reach the users. This rigorous process allows us to maintain a high standard of quality and deliver a reliable product.
