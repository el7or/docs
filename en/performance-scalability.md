# Performance and Scalability

## Load Testing
The Akadimi platform has undergone rigorous **load testing** to ensure its stability and reliability under high-traffic conditions. Results demonstrate that the platform can handle a substantial number of simultaneous users without any significant degradation in performance. These tests validate Akadimi's readiness to support large-scale deployments, making it suitable for educational institutions, publishers, and enterprises with extensive user bases.

## Cloud Hosting
Akadimi leverages a scalable infrastructure hosted on **Microsoft Azure Cloud**, offering robust support for both:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Expanding capacity by adding additional servers or instances to handle increased traffic and workload.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Enhancing the performance of existing resources by upgrading compute power, memory, or storage.

This flexible infrastructure ensures that the platform can adapt seamlessly to meet the growing demands of its users while maintaining high availability and consistent performance. Azure's enterprise-grade cloud solutions provide additional benefits, including:
- **Global Availability**: Ensuring low latency and reliable access for users worldwide.
- **Built-in Security**: Adhering to industry standards for data protection and compliance.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Allowing resources to scale dynamically based on real-time demand, optimizing operational costs.
